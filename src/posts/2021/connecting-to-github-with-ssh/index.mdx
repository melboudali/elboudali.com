Using the SSH protocol, you can connect and authenticate to remote servers and services. With SSH keys, you can connect to GitHub without supplying your email and password every time you push.

When you set up SSH, you will need to generate a new SSH key and add it to the ssh-agent. You must add the SSH key to your account on GitHub before you use the key to authenticate.

# Checking for existing SSH keys

Before you generate an SSH key, you can check to see if you have any existing SSH keys.

Go to the terminal and type:

```
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

It will list down all the ssh keys on your system:

![ssh keys](./assets/1.jpg)

By default, the file names of the public keys are one of the following:

- id_dsa.pub
- id_ecdsa.pub
- id_ed25519.pub
- id_rsa.pub

If the key does not exist, you will have to create a new one.

# Generate the key if it doesn't exist

To generate a new key, you should go to the terminal and type:

```
ssh-keygen -trsa -C your-github-email
```

If you need root privileges you can type:

```
sudo ssh-keygen -trsa -C your-github-email
```

![ssh keys](./assets/2.jpg)

Enter fil in which to save the key or click enter to accept the default file.

![ssh keys](./assets/3.jpg)

Enter the passphrase or click enter to leave it empty.

![ssh keys](./assets/4.jpg)

Repeat the same passphrase you entered in the previous step.

![ssh keys](./assets/5.jpg)

You have successfully created an ssh key.

# Copy the public ssh key content

To display the ssh key content go to the terminal and type:

```
cat /home/moe/.ssh/test_key.pub
```

![ssh keys](./assets/6.jpg)

Select and copy the content:

![ssh keys](./assets/7.jpg)

# Add new ssh key to github

Go to [Github][1] > settings > SSH and GPG keys or click [here](https://github.com/settings/keys).

![ssh keys](./assets/8.png)

Click **New SSH key** button.

![ssh keys](./assets/9.png)

Add Title, paste the key content, click **Add SSH key**, and **Confirm access** with your [GitHub][1] password.

![ssh keys](./assets/10.png)

**That's it!**

Now You can connect to [GitHub][1] without supplying your username and personal access token at each visit.

> **NB**: If you haven't used your SSH key for a year, then GitHub will automatically delete your inactive SSH key as a security precaution.
