I remember the first time I created my resume I used Microsoft word and at that time I didn't have a printer so I tried my friend printer but when I opened the file I found it messy and unreadable after one or two hours I fixed it and I printed it, after that day I decided to convert my resume file to pdf because it doesn't have the Microsoft word compatibility problem but at that time you shall use an online converter until I learned Figma.
